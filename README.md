My name is Jim Wood (Alloona) and I am just getting back onto programming as a hobby. I still have a lot to learn but have worked with php, html, javascript, css, javascript, and C++
My first passion has been electronics repair but I am now trying to get back into learning more about programming. 

I have a poor memory so have forgotten a lot; however, I am picking things up faster than usual. I joined git to report a bug with icecoder but would like to stick around to learn more.

Honestly, I have played around a lot with programming languages in the past but have never been good at the analysis and design end. I am hopeful that I can learn a lot here and be able to help somewhere.
